The notion of density naturally arises in physics
mass objects can be measured, which contains more mass?
A) This lecture room filled with hydrogen
B) a gold ball filled with osium

Density = mass/volume, to the rescue!
Probability can be measured.
Chance can be measured.
Temperature in a scale
Uni(bi)variate densities also encode useful visual info
What is the central tendency(mean), spread (Variance), uni/multi-modal?
Take the famous standard normal distribuition. 69-95-99.7 rule
mass and object and probability
Inference 
Assumption
we have to assume what the perimeters are
Just estimating and unknown probability 
Probabilty density of a data for the kernel density estimation 
Use density curves for the report ->Research
